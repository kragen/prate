<!--
This is, like, close to the simplest possible implementation of a chat
UI in DHTML.  It still has a little bit of “not working because too
simple” to it:

- doesn’t scroll to the bottom if window too small;
- input can hide latest line of output if window too small;
- doesn’t handle HTML chat (or inline images);
- doesn’t style the chat lines;
- doesn’t do timestamps;
- doesn’t let you scroll back into the past.

I want to see if I can hook this up to scalableflooding.js and
localStorage to get a persistent chat log that could, in theory, let
you talk to other people, if only you had a way to connect it to other
users’ chat clients.
